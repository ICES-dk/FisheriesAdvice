Code to aggregate data and create figures for ICES Fisheries Advice Section

Figure 1. ICES official landings by nation of species within the Celtic Seas ecoregion, 2006-2013. [R code](https://github.com/ICES-dk/FisheriesAdvice/blob/master/Figure1.R)

* Notes: ACOM sub-group not interested, but Secretariat leadership asked to include.
* Current format: stacked line graph.
* Data source: 
    + Official nominal catch [here](http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/Documents/CatchStats/OfficialLandings.zip).
    + Preliminary catch data is in [REC-12](http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/dataset-collections/Pages/Fish-catch-and-stock-assessment.aspx). 
        + Anna O can help with any questions. 
        + SL doesn’t think we need the preliminary data for this.

Figure 2. Effort (kW days at sea) by nation reported to STECF within the Celtic Seas ecoregion, 2006-2013.

* Data needed: ?
* Responsible person: Tomas

Figure 3. ICES official landings by species groups within the Celtic Seas ecoregion, 2006-2013.

* Notes: Classify the species by agreed guilds/functional groups using top 3 species/guild. 
    + There should be one plot per guild.
    + MDC was very interested in economic valuation, in addition to this figure. 
      + It would use JRC or DCF economic valuation data.
* Current format: stacked graph.
* Data source: 
    + Official nominal catch [here](http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/Documents/CatchStats/OfficialLandings.zip).
    + Preliminary catch data is in [REC-12](http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/dataset-collections/Pages/Fish-catch-and-stock-assessment.aspx)

Figure 4. Top 10 3 species within each species group for the Celtic Seas ecoregion as reported in the ICES official landings, 2006-2013.

* Notes: reduce to top 3 species within each functional group
* Current format: stacked graph.
* Data source: 
    + Official nominal catch [here](http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/Documents/CatchStats/OfficialLandings.zip).

Figure 5. EU landings by gear within the Celtic Seas ecoregion as available from STECF data. Note: Spanish data only available for 2012-13.

Figure 6. Stock trends of F/Fmsy and total landings volumes removed in relation to Fmsy status, separated by demersal and pelagic stocks within the Celtic Seas ecoregion, 1990-2013. Currently only contains the stocks available in the ICES standard graphs database of 2014 advice.

* Notes: ACOM sub-group does not like the ”spaghetti plots” at the top as they are difficult to make sense of. Is there another visual that could be used? Alternatively, Secretariat staff thought that and Favg could be added as a line to the landings bar graphs.
* Current format: spaghetti plots and stacked graph.

Figure 7. Kobe-plots of Celtic Seas stocks by category (demersal, pelagic, elasmobranch, Nephrops). (Left) Relative fishing pressure (F/Fmsy) and biomass (SSB/Btrig) for stocks, which have SSB and F related against reference points (msy where available, otherwise pa or qualitative. Stocks in the green region are exploited below Fmsy and have an SSB that is above Btrigger. (Right) Stocks of unknown status in relation to reference points. The size of each bubble corresponds to the landings in 2013. (CURRENTLY DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL CELTIC SEAS STOCKS)

* Notes: 
    + ACOM sub-group does not like the use of stock codes. 
        + How can we get around this? 
    + The yellow shading is a problem because it should be red. 
    + Can the circles be colored rather than the background? 
    + Could this resolve some of the challenges with these plots?

Figure 8. Proportion of Celtic Seas stocks by category: (Left) fished at or below Fmsy (green), above Fmsy (red) and of unknown status in relation to fishing mortality reference points. (Right) with biomass above B trigger (green), below B trigger (red) and of unknown status in relation to biomass reference points. (CURRENTLY DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL CELTIC SEAS STOCKS)

Figure yy. Distribution of effort deployed by EU nations by gear type within the Celtic Seas ecoregion, 2003-2013. Data source: STECF database.

Figure xx; Spatial distribution of fishing effort by active demersal gears, during 2012. Adapted from ICES WGSFD, 2014.

* Notes: Assistance needed from Neil/Carlos. 2015 data product by gear needed.

Table 1. Stock status summary of the last three years for those stocks within the Celtic Seas ecoregion.
Notes: ACOM December may decide not to include this information in the ICES advice. Therefore, hold off. Several ACOM members expressed the desire to keep this table. This technically isn’t ”fisheries” information. Perhaps it could be an independent product?

* Current format: tickmark table
* Data source: advice sheets to popular advice standard text table
* Data needed: no
* Responsible person: Anne
* Challenges: waiting for ACOM decision.
* Workload: it is a lot of copy-paste at the moment, but if ACOM decides to keep this in the advice I believe that it will be automatically produced in the SAG database.

* Status: TBD
